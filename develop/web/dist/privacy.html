				<h1>Privacy Policy of Mail helper</h1>

				Last modified: December 29, 2018
		
				<p>
					Mail helper operates on Fireabse web hosting: 
					<a href="https://fir-playgrounds.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank" title="Mail helper">https://fir-playgrounds.firebaseapp.com</a>.
					Mail helper is: 
					<strong>Web mail client</strong>. Application that allows users to read or send email meta data via an user interface.
				</p>

				<h5>Application type</h5>

				<p>
					Mail helper is an 
					<strong>Applications that enhance the email experience for productivity purposes</strong> 
				</p>

				<h5>Terms of service</h5>

				<p>	
					The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, 
					which is accessible at 
					<a href="terms.html" 
						 title="Mail helper - Terms of service" 
						 target="_blank">https://fir-playgrounds.firebaseapp.com/terms.html</a>, 
					unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
				</p>

				<h3>Why I've been working on this tool ?</h3>

				<p>
					Each day my mailbox receives a lot of emails. 
					To reduce my reading time I've been using a lot of labels (at this moment I have 500+ diffferent labels). 
				</p>

				<h5>Structure data</h5>
				
				<p>
					I'd like to introduce a term "on the stage": <strong>structure data</strong>.
					<strong>Structure data</strong> - email message has at least one label.
				</p>

				<p>
					I created this tool because I'd like to increase my productivity. 
					<strong>First version creates a filter and label (if this is necessary !!!)</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>Additional feature is: User can setup label background and text color.</p>

				<p>
					I'd like to explain which <strong>Gmail REST API scope</strong> that is required by my application: 
				</p>

				<h5>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels</h5>

				<p>
					Without this permission application <strong>CAN'T</strong> create a Gmail label. 
					This access gives permissions to my application to access your label meta data.
				</p>

				<h5>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic</h5>

				<p>
					Permission is responsible to create a Gmail Filter and access filter meta data.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you want to understand more about gmail scopes and privacy of your information, please visit: 
					<a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes" title="Gmail scopes" target="_blank">Gmail scopes</a>
				</p>

				<h3>Application workflow / Lifecycle</h3>

				<h5>Authorization</h5>

				<p>
					When an user opens this application for this first time will see a simple button with name: "Authorize".
					Buttons is responsible to create a web token. 
					Web token is able to read gmail meta data, access label meta data and manage basic mail settings.
				</p>
				
				<h5>Application has an authorization access</h5>

				<p>
					If applications has this web token, application loads form that contains these sections: 
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Label name</li>
					<li>Filter name - User could choice to use the same keyword for filter and label name</li>
					<li>
						Label visibility - User can choice three options: 
						<ul>
							<li>Label to be always hidden</li>
							<li>Label always to be visible</li>
							<li>Label to be visible if contains at least one email with is waiting to be read</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Label colors - User can specific label background and text color</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>User wants to create a new filter and label (if this is necessary !!!)</h5>

				<ul>
					<li>
						If algorithm finds a label and that label name is equal to keyword -> tool ONLY creates a new filter.
					</li>
					<li>
						If gmail label meta data doesn't have an information about this keyword -> 
						Application creates label and filter.
					</li>	
				</ul>

				<h3>What this applications stores ?</h3>

				<h5>Application stores json web token after authorization</h5>

				<p>
					Application creates an <strong>unique</strong> web token. 
					If browser has a browser cookie that contains this token and token is valid: 
					Authorization is not required by application. 
				</p>

				<h5>Application is using a background task to "copy" information about label meta</h5>

				<p>
					Application creates an application variable.
					This application variable contains an information about Label meta data.
				</p>

				<p>Why applications need this ? </p>

				<p>
					My application filters this variable related wit desired keyword.
					If keyword exists -> Application creates filter and label at Gmail
				</p>

				<h3>What this application doesn't do</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Our service doesn't <strong>delete or update</strong> your label meta data.
					</li>

					<li>
						Our service doesn't <strong>delete or update</strong> your filter meta data.
					</li>

					<li>
						Our service doesn't <strong>access other mail settings</strong>
					</li>

					<li>
							<strong>Our serice doesn't shares a data with other applications !!!</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
		
				<h3>Hosting</h3>
				
				<p>
					I chose Firebase because this service provides https sertificate. 
					Https provides an encrypted connection between browser and server.
					This connections <strong>DOESN'T</strong> allow something to sniffing web trace and "steal" your web token.
