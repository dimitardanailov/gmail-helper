	<h2>What is Mail helper ? </h2>

	<p>
		Mail helper is a personal assistant that creates Gmail Filter and Labels 
		<span class="special-info">much easier rather than "traditional way".</span>
	</p>

	<h2>Why Mail helper could be uselful ?</h2>

	<p>
		I've been using Gmail since 2010. 
		For this period of time: I unread letters reach number of 2000+. I had almost 450+ labels but this didn't help me.
		My mailbox was one big fat and dirty room ðŸ˜Š ðŸ˜’                                             
	</p>

	<p>
		The cost of creating <span class="special-info">ONLY</span> one filter and label is between three and ten minutes
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="color-warning">I didn't want to pay this high price !!!<span>
	</p>

	<h2>Each story began with "baby" step</h2>

	<p>
		End of 2018 I've decided to create a simple web page which is able to covers my basic requirements: 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Creating label and filter to requires <span class="special-info">Minimum</span> steps
		</li>
		<li>
			Reduce my unread letters
		</li>
		<li>
			Each email to have at least one filter and label
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Personal achievements</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			For me is much easier to organize and read my email box.
		</li>
		<li>
			Gmail label meta data grows with 10 % only for two weeks (From 440 to 476 labels). This is almost 10% growth
		</li>
		<li>
			I did a discovery: Gmail Label could contains emoji !!!  
		</li>
		<li>
			I'm able to choose label background and text color much easier
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Without <span class="color-warning">visual indication</span> 
		which email is helpful and which email is just a spam / garbage: I didn't very well.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each human needs challenges and achievements. 
		My progress with Mail Helper makes me more happy person when I'm using Gmail.
		I have a better knowledge how works Gmail ... and a lot of ideas how to improve Mail Helper ðŸ¤ž
